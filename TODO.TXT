Guiding Principles:

	Keep everything as simple as possible making use of text files and old school tools. All tools required need to be open source and readily available.
	
	Light enough to be built and run on a Raspberry Pi. This inlcudes building the tools as well as the final product.

What problem are we trying to solve?

	Make some proceedural models similar to Starcraft to put onto personal website and school website.
	
Short Term Experiment I:

	Understand if you can use text files or just plain C to make a simple 3D model for a simple game.
	
	Try to use plain C first.
		Plain C does not have any of the niceties that C++ has for vectors.
		I'm missing the ability to rotate, pan, zoom the model from the start.
		Looks like 2D is the only way to go?
		
		Using some graph paper a person can draw in 2D what characters are needed for the artwork.

		Drawing the simplest of 2D letters by hand with verticies is very cumbersome and painful. Moreover, the volume of C code produced is suprisingly large in general and would result in a large volume of source code to represent a small amount of geometry.
				
			vVertices[0] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[1] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[2] = 0.0f;

			vVertices[3] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[4] = 0.3f;
			vVertices[5] = 0.0f;
			
			vVertices[6] = 0.3f;
			vVertices[7] = 0.3f;
			vVertices[8] = 0.0f;
			
			vVertices[9] = 0.3f;
			vVertices[10] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[11] = 0.0f;    
		  
			vVertices[12] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[13] = 0.2f;
			vVertices[14] = 0.0f;  		
		
		Hand hacking a huge array is also painful and even more tedious in general:
	
		vVerticies[] = { 0.2f, 0.2f, 0.0f, 0.2f, 0.3f, 0.0f ... }
		
		Moreover if your rebuild time is very slow at all this can make the process seem worse still. This is being compiled on a Raspberry Pi 2 which isn't aweful but still is a lot of blank staring at a screen.

		3D looks doable but quickly becomes problematic. Too much time spent thinking about what the coordinates are of the individial pieces.

	Write some helper functions to create basic shapes, modify verticies, set color for one vertex and then set color for a range of verticies. (Some function examples are listed below).

	Maybey write a tool that takes in the description of a 3D model and converts it into a C program that gets compiled in the game.  The tool would be a compiler for a Domain Specific Language.

Short Term Experiment II:

	Animate the model created from Experiment I.

Keyboard shortcuts to rotate map.

Keyboard shortcuts to move from one location to another on the map.

Mouse movement to orbit around 3D object?

Determine if external models or internal models will be used.
	External models would be formatted text files that represent a final model in the game.
		Can be modified by others in the class using a seperate modeling tool.
		Can put the models online and let people play with them in the browser and share them online.
		Distribution can be more difficuty for students as more than one file needs to be sent.
	Internal models are made from C code that is embedded into the game engine itself.
		Very much so a programmer art type of methodology.
		Building code must not be too slow or using the external model files will be much faster.
		Especially on a Raspberry Pi system.

When program starts it opens standard file location and reads model information from there.

Attempt to use plain C code in project to generate models.

	Write some functions to generate a cube, make some changes to the cube.

	typedef tuple {
		float x,y,z,w;
	};

	genCube(tuple);
	genColorCube(tuple, tuple);

Modify verticies using a function call.
	modVertColor(tuple);
	modVertPosition(tuple);

Get some organization around how models themselves are managed:
	typedef model {
		float verts[];
		int vertCount;
	};
	
Understand how the animation will be designed by creating a simple animated model to demonstrate.
(Much of the contents of manual will depend on this design.)


FerrisMakesDemos Notes

Needed lower level

Several Global Variables exist:
	width of window in pixels
	height of window in pixels
	time

Execution starts at the master position, then goes down one step at a time. Each box is a single instruction known as an operator.
Each square is a set on a map to operators.

Each Operator has 0 or more parameters that are strings 
Operator strings can be mathematical expressions.

TODO: Make clear operator.
	Clears the screen has three parameters red, green & blue. Each parameter is a float.
std::map<int, int> m{{0,0}}

When putting data into an operator that does not work this log is generated:
CompileError { data: undefinedvar("hi"), source: source { pos: (7,0 ), expr_name" "green" }}

Operators are tagged enums that have a bunch of different kinds of operators.

Example Operators:
	"lc origin..."  (Local operator)
		creates a local variable named origin
		operator finds variable named "origin" pushes it onto the stack
	
	"cl aspect" (call operator)
	"if width..."  (Conditional operator)
	"sb aspect..."  (Subroutine operator) name: "aspectGreater"
		sb says to call a subroutine with the name as a string to the right
	"vp " is a ViewPoint Operator
	"rt " is a Render Target Operator
	
Each operator has an expression represented by strings.

A call operator will call the cell to the left.
Execution stops when the next cell is empty.

Some operators have operations that are scoped

TODO: Understand how we can make a JIT that converts these code strings into executable code. This code should be executed on the fly each time a change is made.  (This code may be very operating system dependant).  Instead of making this binary code perhaps it could be interpreted and read one line at a time from an editor.

TODO: When a change is made to the code and it is saved, the system notices it, recompiles and runs it automatically. Need to find out how to do this (which may also be operating system dependant).

DoomEd Notes


All of the DoomEd files are flat text files.
Zoom settings: 3.135, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400

Grid snaps at different levels. Levels go from 1 to 64. The drid is drawn on the map in two different sizes: 1. Wider, darker lines every 8x8 and thinner lighter lines each grid location.

Tools Menu:
	Select				Pick something on the map to view its details in the line inspector
	Poly line
	Line
	Zoom
	Move				Drag and move map around on screen.
	Selexctor get/fill
	New thing
	Launch & Save


Error log window shows text of errors in system.
